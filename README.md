## What i learned in my prework

Being new to developing i had to pay close attintion to wht i was reading and assorb alot of info.:

- I was motivated by my interest in the subject matter I find the ability to turn code in to a working platform is very cool.
- I felt like this poject was great way to get comfortable with the use of the different tools i will use throughout the course.
- While going through the moduals i ran into several mistakes were my ending product wasn't what it was supposed to be so i would go back through my code and fix my mistake which thought me that it comes down to even missing hitting the space bar could mess up the whole code which is also what makes codeing so interesting me.
- I learned alot while going through the moduals i could write a book on everything i learned but to simplify i learned the purpose of each element (HMTL, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript) and the importance of how they effect the webpage if not done correctly.

## Installation

The software you need to get sarted are Git, Google crome, VSC, and a GitHub account. All of these are very easy to find and install and the links provided in the link made it that much easier. once installed you need to create an account with GitHub and create you project and then link with VSC and a local link to your computer aswell as setup in your command line so that you can work on your local deveice as well as remotely with GitHub. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
